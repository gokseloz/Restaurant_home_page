# Created a Turkish Resturant Home Page 

Highlighted Points:
1) Hamburger-menu icon is clickable and has nice effect when clicking. It is created with "input checkbox" and "label" elements (checkbox"s id name is same with label"s id name)
2) It is responsive and works with all screen sizes.
3) Css combinators are used such as "adjacent sibling" and "general sibling" selectors
4) Openable side menu is created with nice transition effect.
5) Enjoy looking at delicious turkish meals and I hope one day you get a chance to try all of them :)
