Highlighted Points:
1) Hamburger-menu icon is clickable and it is created with "input checkbox" and "label" elements (checkbox"s id name is same with label"s id name)
2) It is responsive and works with all screen sizes.
3) Css combinators used such as "adjacent sibling" and "general sibling" selectors
4) Openable side menu is created with nice transition effect.
